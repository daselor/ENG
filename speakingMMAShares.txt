. MMA Shares

. It's an app that uses MMA fighters as shares. You can 
buy them and if they become greater fighters in real life 
or their reputation increases your shares will have more value. 
Every day there are some fighters you can bid for them in an 
auction. The purpose is to compare the fighters you have with
your friends and see if they have better fighters.
This app is inspired in La Liga Fantasy, a very popular one that
uses football players. We've decided to expand that app to other 
niches.

. Our objective is to monetize by selling lootboxes that 
gives you the chance of getting the fighter you want. 
Other way to monetize is by asking for a commision in P2P sales.
Users will be able to sell very uncommon fighters with real
currency to other users interested.


. Our target audience is all the MMA community.

. (logo, slogan, image): Cuanto mayor es la lucha, mayor es el resultado.

. (Extra features and additional information): P2P of fighters.
