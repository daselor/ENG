. MMA Shares

. It's an app that uses MMA fighters as shares. You can 
buy them and if they become greater fighters in real life 
or their reputation increases your shares will have more value. 
Every day there are some fighters you can bid for them in an 
auction. The purpose is to compare the fighters you have with
your friends and see if they have better fighters.
This app is inspired in La Liga Fantasy, a very popular one that
uses football players. We've decided to expand that app to other 
niches.

. Our objective is to monetize by selling lootboxes that 
gives you the chance of getting the fighter you want. 
Other way to monetize is by asking for a commision in P2P sales.
Users will be able to sell very uncommon fighters with real
currency to other users interested.


. Our main audience is MMA fans, especially teenagers and young 
adults. We know this crowd is all about staying up-to-date with 
their favorite fighters, matches, and the latest news, so we 
built this app to be their go-to for everything MMA.

. Our logo has a bold, edgy look to it—just like MMA itself. 
We wanted it to be intense and memorable so fans feel that 
connection right away. Our slogan, “Manage your hobbie” 
really captures what we’re going for: it’s not just about 
watching MMA, but actually feeling that you are managing and 
a very inmersive experience.

The app’s design is super simple and easy to use. We made sure it’s visually exciting but also quick to navigate, so users can jump right into the latest content. Our goal? To make this app the ultimate spot for MMA fans to stay connected and pumped up about the sport. Thanks for listening!
