. MMA Shares

. It's an app that uses MMA fighters as shares. You can 
buy them and if they become greater fighters in real life 
or their reputation increases your shares will have more value. 
Every day there are some fighters you can bid for them in an 
auction. The purpose is to compare the fighters you have with
your friends and see if they have better fighters.
This app is inspired in La Liga Fantasy, a very popular one that
uses football players. We've decided to expand that app to other 
niches.

// Part of Darío Segarra:

. One way we found for monetizing the app is by the sales of lootboxes.

Have you ever heard of lootboxes?
They are boxes that give you the change of getting the fighter
you want. The users pay more or less depending on what exclusive fighter
they can get. The prices would be from 1$ to 5$.

Other way to monetize is by asking for a commission in P2P sales.
Users will be able to sell very uncommon fighters with real
currency to other users interested. The users set the price and if
someone thinks that the fighter is worth that money he could pay it.
We will be asking for a 1% of that transaction.

- target audience
- logo

. Our main audience is MMA fans, especially teenagers and young 
adults. We know this crowd is all about staying up-to-date with 
their favorite fighters, matches, and the latest news, so we 
built this app to be their go-to for everything MMA.

. Our logo has a red and agressive look, like MMA itself. 
We wanted it to be intense and memorable so fans feel that 
connection right away. Our slogan, “Manage your favorite fighters” 
really captures what we’re going for: it’s not just about 
watching MMA, but actually feeling that you are managing and 
a very inmersive experience.
