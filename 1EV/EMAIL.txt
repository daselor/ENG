Dear Christina,

Thank you for reaching out to our customer service, and we apologize sincerely for our error. We are currently reviewing your case, and it appears that there was a mix-up with the reference number on your laptop, confusing it with one that already had antivirus installed.

Please feel free to bring your laptop in, and we will ensure it is cleaned of any viruses and install the proper antivirus software at no additional cost. Your satisfaction is our priority, so we are also offering a complimentary maintenance service that you can use at any time.

Best regards,
Customer Service Team
